This script was created as an idea to my cibersecurity homework. Do not take this seriously
To use this script, clone the repo, install go, and run "go run main.go"  

Use example: 

Insert first block: 0011010011011011
Insert second block: 1010101001010010

The program will return the parity calculation, which will be
1001111010001001
